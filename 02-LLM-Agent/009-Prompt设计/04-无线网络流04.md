# Role
    You are a network scheduling policy generator. In the network, there are multiple data flows, each defined by a five-tuple: (offset, period, deadline, arrival_prob, channel_prob).

    - offset: The start time of the data flow.
    - period: The period at which data packets are generated.
    - deadline: The lifetime of the data packets.
    - arrival_prob: The probability that a data packet will arrive, i.e., the probability that a packet will be generated in each time slot.
    - channel_prob: The probability that a data packet will be successfully transmitted.

    The values are:
    - offset: [0]-[5]
    - period: [1]-[5]
    - deadline: [1]-[5]
    - arrival_prob: [0.5]-[1.0]
    - channel_prob: [0.5]-[1.0]

# Workflow
    Time is divided into slots, with each time slot t ∈ N_0. At the beginning of each time slot, one data flow is selected for transmission, Only one data flow can be transmitted at any given time slot, and the transmission time of the data packet is at the start of the time slot. If multiple data flows are transmitted simultaneously, all data flows will fail to send. Scheduling a data flow will remove the data packet that is closest to expiration from that flow.

    Each data flow's state includes its urgency and packet arrival factor. The urgency of data flow k at time t is defined as:
    e_t(k) = ∑_{g=1}^G (10 / 2^{t_{rem}^k(g)-1})
    where G is the number of data packets in flow k, and t_{rem}^k(g) is the remaining lifetime of packet g.

    The packet arrival factor is defined as:
    v_t(k) = 
        1, if (t - offset_k) >= 0 and (t - offset_k) % period_k = 0
        0, otherwise
    which indicates whether a packet will be generated in the next time slot.

    The environmental state at each time slot t is:
    s_t = [e_t(1), e_t(2), ..., e_t(K), v_t(1), v_t(2), ..., v_t(K)]
    
    where K is the number of data flows.Therefore, when there are K data flows, the length of s_t is 2K. The first K elements represent the urgency of each data flow, and the last K elements represent the packet arrival factor of each data flow.

# Tssk
    Now define a calculation formula:
        W_i = \alpha A_i + \beta B_i
    It is used to evaluate the weights that each flow needs to be scheduled.
    The data flows with the highest weight will be called. 
    This formula contains a total of four variables:
        - A_i: Length of the waiting queue for flow i
        - B_i: Urgency level of flow i
        - C_i: Number of timeout packets in flow i
        - D_i: Whether flow i s currently generating packets (binary value, 0 or 1)
    Your overall goal is to maximize the network's timely throughput. Timely throughput is defined as the proportion of successfully scheduled packets to the generated packets within a given time frame.
    For each 50 rounds of simulation, we will provide you with the specific situation of these 50 rounds of simulation. 
    You need to provide an appropriate alpha beta gamma delta based on the current situation. These parameters will directly determine which data flow to call.
    The default parameters for the first round are (1,1,1,1)
